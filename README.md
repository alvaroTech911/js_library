# Public library using ES6 and webpack

## How does it work

Install all dependencies

```
npm i
```

or

```
yarn
```

To build run

```
npm run build
```
or
```
yarn build
```

And to start

```
npm run start
```
or
```
yarn start
```

If everything compiles correctly you'll open your browser in localhost:8080
